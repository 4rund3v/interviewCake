### __`𝙸𝙽𝚃𝚁𝙾𝙳𝚄𝙲𝚃𝙸𝙾𝙽`__

- I'm not a big fan of Competitive Programming, and it's not my cup of tea. Don't get me wrong, I love solving questions, but I don't take programming as a sport.

- I try to solve problems when I'm free. There are lots of cool places for it, but for some reasons, I like Interview Cake.

- Interview Cake is not free. I mean the questions. After every two weeks, the problem gets moved to the Premium Course.


### __`𝚆𝙷𝚈`__

- I don't have any solid reason to put the content here, but I thought it might be useful to people who wants to solve some good problem and learn something useful.

- Another thing - the problems are going to stay here for a long-long time. So you don't have
to worry about the weeks.
