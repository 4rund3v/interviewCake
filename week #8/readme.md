## Hooray! It's opposite day. Linked lists go the opposite way today.

Write a function for reversing a `linked list`. Do in __`in place`__ (algorithm).

Your function will have one input: the head of the list.

Your function should return the new head of the list.

Here's a sample linked list node class:

__`JavaScript`__

```js
class LinkedListNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```
