## Gotchas

We can do this in _O_(1) space. So don't make a new list; use the existing list nodes!

We can do this is in _O(n)_ time.

Carefulâ€”even the right _approach_ will fail if done in the wrong _order_.

Try drawing a picture of a small linked list and running your function by hand. Does it actually work?

The most obvious edge cases are:

1. the list has 0 elements

2. the list has 1 element

Does your function correctly handle those cases?
