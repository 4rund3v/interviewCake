## Gotchas

__You can't just take the difference between the highest price and the lowest price__, because the highest price might come
_before_ the lowest price. And you have to buy _before_ you can sell.

What if the price _goes down all day?_ In that case, the best profit will be __negative.__

You can do this _O(n) time and O(1) space!_
